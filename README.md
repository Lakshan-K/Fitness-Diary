# Fitness_Diary
A password protected fitness diary.
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a password protected Fitness Diary. You can create an account in the account creation page which will store your username, password and recovery question using local storage. In the login page you can login to the new entry page (which is essentially your diary page) if your username and password matches the one that was created in the account creation page. If you forgot your password you can recover it by clicking the forgot password hyperlink and if you select the correct security question and answer you will get an alert that displays your password. In the new entry page you can log your workouts using text, pictures, and a customizable layout. When you submit your entry it will get saved to your device using local storage and when you click load up it will retrieve your previous entry and display it in the textbox. You can then log out and lock your diary using the "log out & lock" button.
